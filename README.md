**Automated Continuous Integration and Evaluation for Android Projects**

## Overview

This project automates the build, test, and evaluation processes for Android projects submitted by students through GitHub Classroom. The workflow includes comprehensive unit tests, Android tests, and an automated evaluation system that assesses student assignments without manual intervention.

## Workflow

1. **Assignment Creation**: Professors create assignments in GitHub Classroom.

2. **Repository Creation**: Students, upon assignment submission, receive a dedicated repository for their task.

3. **GitHub Actions Trigger**: GitHub Actions is triggered automatically upon each assignment submission.

4. **Build Process**: The CI pipeline builds the Android project.

5. **Unit Testing**: Automated unit tests are executed to ensure code integrity.

6. **Android Testing**: Device or emulator-based tests are performed to validate app behavior.

7. **Automated Evaluation**: Custom scripts or testing frameworks assess the correctness and completeness of the student's code.

8. **Feedback and Results**: Evaluation results are provided to the student automatically.
